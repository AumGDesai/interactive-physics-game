# Interactive Physics Game â€“ Animated Collision Simulation

This project builds upon a prior object-oriented simulation framework to create an **interactive physics-based game**, where the user controls shapes and navigates a dynamic environment with animated collisions.

### Project Highlights
- Real-time user interaction and control
- Simulated physics (gravity, collisions, boundaries)
- Object-oriented programming with encapsulated physics objects
- Built-in **game loop and animation** using `graphicsPlus.py`

### Features
- **Player-controlled shape objects**
- Obstacles and moving elements with collision detection
- Smooth animation with visual feedback
- Modular and extensible code (e.g. `physics_objects.py`, `collision.py`)

### Skills Demonstrated
- Python-based OOP design
- Event handling and simulation timing
- Custom graphics and animation
- Interactive control systems
- Code structure for small games
